StampDutyCalculator
===================

Calculator that implements Osbourne's new stamp duty calculation method.

**A simple stamp duty calculator to calculate tax according to a property's value in the UK.**

An interview question that I screwed up badly. The interviewer must have thought I didn't know how to code. He did teach me some interesting stuff though.

This is the supposed correct implementation. Embarassingly enough, a question that took me an hour and yet I still couldn't solve is now solved in 10 minutes. Way to go, William!
